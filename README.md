# SpaDes

Spacecraft Design tool. Takes as an input a list of payloads and an orbit and produces a design and estimated cost. 
WIP: Produces a list of components and automatically generates a configuration.

Runnable code script is SpacecraftDesignMain.py. This picks a random payload and orbit and generates a design.

Modules communicate via JSON files for flexibility. May switch to transferring objects at some point for speed.
